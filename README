Project Statement #7) Implement a doctor-patient appointment system

System consists of python files, databases and sql files

Installation & Initial Setup:

  The system uses many modules (via import statements), most of which already exist inside of the standard library, and do not need to be installed.
  However, the names module does not exist in the standard library and will need to be installed by the user.
  Open a terminal, and execute the following command. Ensure the installed module exists in the same direc as the system files

  pip3 install names


Using the system:

  To use the system, run the driver python file, using the following command
  python3 Driver.py
  
  The system uses string matching to validate all inputs. As such, ensure all spelling is correct
  
  Format for entering a illness: 
    The first letter of the illness must be capital, all remaining words/letters must be lowercase
    
     At this time, a limited number of illnesses are supported by the system.
     For now the system is limited to a set of illnesses, given below in the following format "illness" : "Category"
     When prompted for an illness by the system, enter one of the following illnesses as given below (ex: Arrhythmia or Celiac disease)
